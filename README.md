# WebBro - Learning Path Platform

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

WebBro is a learning path platform designed to guide users through structured learning experiences. This project is inspired by **Frontend Mentor** challenges but tailored for a full-stack learning experience.

---

## Features

- **Learning Paths**: Users can explore and follow structured learning paths.
- **Step Navigation**: Each learning path consists of steps (articles or challenges) with clear navigation.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their progress through each step and stage.
- **Dynamic Step Stages**: Challenges are divided into stages, and progress is updated dynamically.
- **Role-Based Access**: Future-proofed for user role validation and permissions.

---

## Business Scenarios

### 1. **Dashboard**
- **URI**: `/learning-paths`
- **Description**: Displays a list of all learning paths with progress previews.

### 2. **Start Learning Path**
- **URI**: `/learning-paths/{learningPathId}/start`
- **Description**: Initializes a learning path and redirects to the first step.

### 3. **Continue Learning**
- **URI**: `/learning-paths/{learningPathId}/continue`
- **Description**: Redirects the user to the next unfinished step in the learning path.

### 4. **Open Step**
- **URI**: `/learning-paths/{learningPathId}/steps/{stepId}/open`
- **Description**: Opens a specific step (article or challenge) and determines its stage.

### 5. **Complete Step**
- **URI**: `/learning-paths/{learningPathId}/steps/{stepId}/complete`
- **Description**: Marks the current step as completed and redirects to the next step.
